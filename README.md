# Next.js 15 Middleware Authentication Redirect Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 when using middleware for authentication redirects. The error is intermittent, making it challenging to consistently reproduce and debug. The issue seems to relate to how the middleware interacts with the authentication status check and subsequent redirect.

## Bug Description

The application attempts to redirect users to a login page if they are not authenticated.  The redirect logic is implemented within a middleware function.  However, the application intermittently throws an error, seemingly unrelated to the authentication status. The error is not consistent and doesn't appear in all cases.

## Reproduction

Steps to reproduce the bug are not guaranteed, as the error's intermittent nature makes it difficult to pinpoint a reliable process.

## Potential Causes

Possible causes might involve:

* **Asynchronous Operations:** Race conditions or timing issues with asynchronous authentication checks.
* **Middleware Execution Order:** Unexpected behavior related to how middleware functions are executed.
* **Next.js Internal State:**  A potential bug within the Next.js framework itself related to middleware or redirects.

## Solution

The solution, implemented in `bugSolution.js`, involves reviewing the authentication mechanism for potential race conditions or timing issues, ensuring that the authentication check is fully resolved before the redirect is initiated.  This may involve using promises or async/await to ensure the asynchronous check completes before the response is sent.
